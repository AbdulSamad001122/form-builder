# Formit — Form Builder SaaS

A production-style Typeform-inspired form builder built with Turborepo, tRPC, Drizzle ORM, Zod, and Next.js. Create dynamic forms, publish shareable links, collect responses and view analytics — all inside a polished monorepo architecture.

## 📢 Evaluator & Judge Notes

Welcome, Judges! I have upgraded Formit's email infrastructure and resolved several critical database/UI bugs to ensure a smooth evaluation experience:

### ✉️ 1. Brevo Email Migration & Dynamic Creator Delivery
- **Dynamic Routing**: Form submissions dynamically notify the form's creator directly. Note that if you test submissions using the pre-seeded demo account (`demo@formit.dev`), you will **not** receive an email because that address is fictional and doesn't have a real inbox.
- **How to Test Delivery**: Simply **sign up with your own real active email account** and submit a response to one of your forms; the submission notification will land in your inbox instantly!

## ✨ Features

### Creator Features
- **Authentication** — Secure credential-based creator auth (self-hosted HMAC-SHA256 + salt)
- **Form Builder** — Drag-and-drop field editor with fractional indexing for smooth field reordering
- **Field Types** — TEXT, LONG_TEXT, EMAIL, NUMBER, YES_NO, PASSWORD, SINGLE_SELECT, MULTI_SELECT, CHECKBOX, DROPDOWN, RATING, DATE
- **Field Config** — Required/optional toggle, placeholders, and choice values
- **Visual Logic branching & Canvas** — Interactive logic map mapping paths visually with specific option handles (blue dots) and generic "Otherwise" fallback handles (black dots)
- **Custom Slugs (Bonus)** — Custom slug support enabling public form URLs like `/f/my-survey-slug` which resolve dynamically in the backend (with fallback UUID query support)
- **Workspace Custom Branding** — Live brand image uploads stored in Cloudinary and custom color palette overrides (background, text, cards, and input fields)
- **Password Protected Forms (Bonus)** — Secure, cookie-based authenticated form filling using encrypted password verification
- **Form Expiry & Response Limit (Bonus)** — Automatic expiration and limits validation during response submissions
- **QR Code Sharing** — Generates and downloads high-quality QR codes for instant sharing
- **Visibility Modes** — `PUBLIC` (visible in explore page listings) or `UNLISTED` (hidden from Explore, accessible only via direct URL)
- **Response Analytics** — Interactive dashboards showing 7-day trend charts, total forms, submissions, published/draft status, and list of responses
- **CSV Response Export (Bonus)** — Client-side CSV generation and download of responses data
- **Edit & Delete Forms** — Core CRUD features
- **Duplicate Forms (Bonus)** — One-click form cloning which performs a deep copy of form meta and all associated form fields (maintaining choice fields, reordering indices, and visual logic rules perfectly) with a custom `(copy)` title suffix.

### Respondent Features
- **Public Form Filling** — Fast, unauthenticated form filling with a two-step capture flow
- **Dynamic UX Progress (Bonus)** — Responsive indicators that dynamically show "Final Question" and "Ready to submit" on logic forms, hiding absolute step counts to maintain fluid progress

### Discovery Features
- **Explore Gallery** — Live community dashboard containing all public published forms

## 🛠 Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm >= 9
- PostgreSQL database
- Cloudinary account (for brand logo uploads)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd trpc-monorepo
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the `.env` file in each relevant package and fill in your values:

**`packages/database/.env`**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/formit
```

**`packages/services/.env`**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/formit
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=your_cloudinary_folder_name
```

**`apps/api/.env`**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/formit
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
PORT=4000

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=your_cloudinary_folder_name
```

**`apps/web/.env`**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### 4. Run database migrations

```bash
pnpm --filter @repo/database db:migrate
```

### 5. Seed demo data

```bash
pnpm --filter @repo/database db:seed
```

### 6. Start development servers

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts both `apps/api` (port 4000) and `apps/web` (port 3000) concurrently via Turborepo.

## 📖 API Documentation

The backend exposes a full OpenAPI spec generated from tRPC routes using `trpc-to-openapi`.

| Endpoint       | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `/docs`        | Interactive Scalar API documentation |

## 🌱 Seeding the Database

The seed script creates a demo user and 3 themed sample forms with realistic responses and analytics data.

```bash
pnpm --filter @repo/database db:seed
```

After seeding:
- **Demo user** is created (see Demo Credentials above)
- **3 themed forms** are created (Customer Satisfaction Survey, Hackathon Registration 2026, Movie Night Picks)
- **~15 realistic responses** with answers are seeded across all forms
